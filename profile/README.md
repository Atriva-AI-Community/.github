# 🤖 Atriva AI Community

Welcome to **Atriva AI Community** — an open-source initiative helping developers and new engineers **build real-world Edge AI products** from idea to deployment.

We believe in *learning by building*.  
Our projects combine **AI inference**, **edge computing**, **vision pipelines**, and **UI/UX design** to help engineers develop a **product mindset** — not just code.

---
